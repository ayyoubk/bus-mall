## Reflections and Comments

- April 18, 2021
    1. create new branch with normal HTML strcture
    2. Create a constructor function that creates an object associated with each product, and has the following properties:
        1. Name of the product
        2. File path of image
        3. Times the image has been shown
    3. Create an algorithm that will randomly generate three unique product images from the images directory and display them side-by-side-by-side in the browser window.
    4. For each of the three images, increment its property of times it has been shown by one.
    5. Attach an event listener to the section of the HTML page where the images are going to be displayed.
    6. In the constructor function define a property to hold the number of times a product has been clicked.After every selection by the viewer, update the newly added property to reflect if it was clicked.
    7. By default, the user should be presented with 25 rounds of voting before ending the session. Keep the number of rounds in a variable to allow the number to be easily changed for debugging and testing purposes.
    8. After voting rounds have been completed, remove the event listeners on the product.
    9. Add a button (View Results), which when clicked displays the list of all the products followed by the votes received, and number of times seen for each.
